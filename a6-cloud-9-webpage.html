    <h2 id="what is python">What is Python</h2>
    <p>Python was originally conceptualized by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s as a member of the National Research Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science. Initially, it was designed as a response to the ABC programming language that was also foregrounded in the Netherlands. Python is a high level  programming language, meaning it’s far from a machine language, making it easier for beginners to read and grasp. Furthermore, being a general purpose programming language, Python is quite versatile for different sorts of projects.
    Everything you need for writing Python is free and available online, the language is open source and free to use for everyone, even for commercial projects and applications.</p>

    <p>Basically you just need to install Python on your computer and pick a text editor to write your code. Then just use your Terminal to execute your programs or alternatively use the platforms offered by some text editors.
    There are plenty of reasons why Python is well-suited for anyone just getting into programming. Let me point out that, since it was my first language, I might be a bit biased. You know, like moms are with their first children.</p>
      
    A couple reasons why Python has gained popularity:
        1. Clear, readable syntax
        2. Quick progression
        3 .Versatility
        4. Widely available resources

    <p>Big organization such as Google, Instagram, YouTube and even Quora use Python. In the O’Reilly 2016 Data Science Salary Survey, 54% of the respondents indicated using Python in the data science industry (Compare with the 2015 Data Science Salary Survey, where 51% of the respondents indicated the use of Python in their daily working lives). In this area, Python competes with R, a language and environment that were specifically built for statistical computing and graphics.</p>

    <h2 id="sentiment analysis">What is Sentiment Analysis?</h2>
    
    <p>In August of 2014, Oxford Dictionaries <a href="http://time.com/3109043/oxford-dictionaries-adds-hot-mess-side-boob-throw-shade/">announced</a> a new batch of additions, amongst them, <em>Sentiment Analysis</em>. The entry states that it is "[t]he process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral." (<a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sentiment_analysis">source</a>)</p>
    
    <p>While the concept might not be exactly new, the tools to perfect the extraction and analysis processes receive a considerable amount of attention from a diverse pool of fields of research. The definition itself hints at sentiment analysis covering reactions to a product, and one could safely infer how that information can be used by the manufacturers in order to improve the product itself or its marketing strategy. Besides that, sentiment analysis is known to aid in areas such as economy, advertising, sociology, and political science.</p>
    
    <p>This paper will explore the use of sentiment analysis in social media as implemented using the Python programming language along with a couple of its downloadable libraries. It will present a simple script as an introduction to the process and briefly point out its inner workings noting Python's flexible syntax as an argument for its wide use for these scripts. </p>
    
    
    <h3>SETTING UP PYTHON-TWITTER INTEGRATION:</h3>
    
    <p>The chosen platform to interact with the sentiment analysis script was Twitter due to the shortness of their messages and the tools readily available for this task: Tweepy and TextBlob. </p>
    
    <p><a href="https://www.pythoncentral.io/introduction-to-tweepy-twitter-for-python/
        5 https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/">Tweepy</a> "enables Python to communicate with Twitter platform and use its API" and <a href="https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/index.html">Textblob</a> is a "library for processing textual data". Once Tweepy provides the credentials for accessing Twitter's users' messages (called 'tweets'), Textblob turns them into classifiable elements and starts the analysis stage.</p>
    
    <p>"The sentiment property returns a named tuple of the form Sentiment(polarity, subjectivity). The polarity score is a float within the range [-1.0, 1.0]. The subjectivity is a float within the range [0.0, 1.0] where 0.0 is very objective and 1.0 is very subjective." (<a href="https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/quickstart.html#sentiment-analysis">source</a>)</p>
    
    <p>Based on the ratings, the script places the tweet into the positive, negative, or neutral categories and prints a small amount of messages for each segment, according to the parameters inserted onto the script's query field of the main function.</p>
    
    <p>It should be noted that this is far from being the only implementation possible, new Natural Languages Toolkit-based tools are being developed for this purpose at a steady pace (<a href="https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment">VADER Sentiment Analysis</a> is an example).
    
    <h3>CONCLUSION:</h3>
    
    <p>While the enormous challenge of analyzing natural languages seems daunting, the implementation of analyzers in Python proves to be easy and lightweight. </p>
    
    <p>The shortcomings of the output are expected (given the extremely basic framework and small input) but Python's ability to produce these scripts with ease as well as <a href="https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/quickstart.html#textblobs-are-like-python-strings">integrate its built-in string/substring methods</a> for better data management and control justify its extensive use for this purpose. </p>
