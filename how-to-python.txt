How to start programming with python!

With any kind of language, be a computer language or written language, 
it can be difficult.  You always want to start slow and with the basics
if possible.

I had a chance to sit down with my significant other and talk to her about
as she was self teaching herself python for her current job.

One thing we agreed on is that it takes time and that it takes patience.
Learning a new language can be difficult from the syntax to the sheer
amount of what you can do with that.  When my significant other was
learning she was utilizing code academy.  It is very nice since it 
allows you to take it slow and learn at your rate with no pressure,
the quizzes are also nice as well to help cement in your mind some of
the concepts.

Personally learning your first language can help you set a good foundation
for learning others.  I found after learning python, that Java, HTML, and CSS
were a lot easier to understand.  I myself also utilized code academy
to self teach and continue teaching myself some programming languages
Some basics to start with that I would recommend would be:

1) Talk to someone who programs, you would be suprised from the amount
of knowledge you can gain from it.

2)Make sure you want to learn the language. Do some research and get
an idea.  Nothing is worse than starting, then realizing that you
are not enjoying it.

3) If after step 1 and 2 has been done and you want to continue, 
then I would start with code academy! Learn the basics from printing
messages, to learning what variables are.
